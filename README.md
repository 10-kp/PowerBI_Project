## Project Overview

This Power BI project analyzes data from a student survey conducted across various retail stores in the United States. The dataset includes information on how students spend on different categories such as Video games, Indoor games, Toys, Books, Gadgets, etc. The primary goal is to derive meaningful insights based on store location and store setting attributes.

## Project Deliverables

### 1. Tabular Visualization:

Displays Total Amount of Purchase (TAP) formatted by store location and store setting, with conditional formatting based on spend ranges

### 2. Matrix Visualization:

Shows the amount spent on Outdoor sports across different ages and store settings, with color formatting for spend   amounts.

### 3. Funnel Chart:

Illustrates the total amount of purchase by store setting, with data labels represented as percentages.

### 4. Pie Chart:

Presents the total amount of purchase by store location specifically for Suburban store settings, leveraging filter     context.

### 5. Scatter Plot (a):

Analyzes Video games purchase versus Outdoor sports spending across different age groups.

### 6. Sand Dance Plot (b):

Explores Indoor sports versus Video games spending across different age groups.

### 7. Data Security:

Implements data access restrictions based on user roles defined in a user mapping table, ensuring users only access data relevant to their designated store setting.

### 8. Deployment and Automation:

- Publishes the report on Power BI cloud service and designs a Master Dashboard featuring the Funnel chart and scatter
  plots.
- Sets up scheduled refresh for the dashboard to update six times daily, every 4 hours.

### 9. Q&A Feature:

- Utilizes Power BI's Q&A feature to:
  - Display the average age of students.
  - Create a Donut chart showcasing total purchases by store location.

## Project Management

The project involves creating visualizations, applying formatting, implementing security measures, and scheduling    
data refreshes to ensure up-to-date insights.

## Technologies Used

Power BI, Power BI Service (Cloud), DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

## Next Steps

Further enhancements may include additional visualizations or deeper analysis into specific spending patterns or       demographic trends.
